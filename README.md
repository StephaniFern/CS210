A school project I completed in C++.


Airgead Banking wanted a program that would display customer information, such as monthly deposits, initial investments, and annual interest over a number of years. The console displays two reports - one is year end balances and interest earned if the customer made no additional deposits. The other shows year end balances and interest earned based on monthly deposits set by the customer. Airgead Banking also wanted code that adheres to their best practices, being transferable, readable, and reusable.

I think I followed industry practices well, creating a program that takes and accurately displays and validates user input. When it comes to improving my code, I feel like I could declutter it. There’s quite a bit and some of it is repetitive. As I improve as a programmer, I’ll be able to write better code that more reusable and easier to read. 

As silly as it seems, I actually struggled with getting the displays to show up correctly. They were out of sync a lot and all over the place. I had to team with a friend and they showed me examples of their code and what they would do to fix the issue. They advised that I treat it like a math problem and calculate where each asterisk needs to be. And most importantly, they reminded me to continuously run my code every few lines instead of writing big blocks of it and trying to find the errors later.

That is perhaps one of the most important take aways. I’m not quite an expert - I’m still learning. But, I will remember the advise of my friends to take it slow and hit run every few lines.
